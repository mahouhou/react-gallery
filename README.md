# Zesty

A simple photo gallery carousel website.

## Forked

I worked on this project as part of the SuperHi coursework (ReactJS). I forked the project in order to redesign the gallery navigation slightly. Instead of clicking on the images to cycle through them, I added forward and back arrows to the counter at the bottom.

## Getting started
