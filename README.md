# Zesty

## A React photo gallery component

This project was part of the SuperHi ReactJS coursework. I developed the photo gallery further to improve the user experience and code reusability.

View it live [here](https://mahouhou.github.io/zesty-gallery/).

By completing this project, I learned:

* how to make a loading component that counts how many images have loaded
* and `useState()` to display the live progress as a progress bar
